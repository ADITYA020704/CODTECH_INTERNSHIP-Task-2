TASK_2:PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT-
Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the
regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy

A predictive modeling project using linear regression to predict laptop prices involves several systematic steps, from defining the objectives to deploying the final model. Here is an overview of the steps you can follow:

# 1. Define Objectives and Questions
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate the prices of laptops based on their features.
Questions:
What are the key features influencing laptop prices?
How accurate is the linear regression model in predicting laptop prices?
# 2. Data Collection
Obtain a dataset containing information about laptops, including their features (e.g., brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size) and prices. This can be sourced from websites like Kaggle, e-commerce sites, or other online data repositories like kaggle or github.
# 3. Data Understanding
Data Overview: Examine the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, and types of variables.
Initial Observations: Look for any immediate patterns or outliers in the data.
# 4. Data Cleaning
Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
Duplicates: Check for and remove duplicate records.
Inconsistencies: Resolve any inconsistencies in data (e.g., different units of measurement).
# 5. Data Exploration
Univariate Analysis:
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each feature.
Visualizations: Histograms, box plots.
Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation analysis between features and the target variable (price).
Scatter plots, pair plots.
# 6. Feature Engineering
Categorical Variables: Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize or scale the data if required (especially for features with different scales).
# 7. Splitting the Data
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate the model's performance.
# 8. Model Building
Linear Regression Model: Fit a linear regression model to the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
# 9. Model Interpretation
Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the price.
Identify which features are the most significant predictors of laptop prices.
# 10. Model Improvement
Feature Selection: Remove or add features based on their importance and the model's performance.
# 13. Deployment
Prepare the model for deployment by saving it using tools like joblib or pickle.
Create a user interface or API to allow users to input laptop features and get price predictions.
# 15. Documentation and Reproducibility
Document all steps taken during the project.
Ensure that the code and analysis are reproducible by others.
# Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels.
